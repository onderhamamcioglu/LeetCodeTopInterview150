This repository contains my solutions to the LeetCode's [Top Interview 150](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/) questions list (No, I did not misspell it).

If you are seeking solutions and have found your way here, ***I recommend checking other repositories and websites.***

If you are an employer reviewing my GitHub repositories, please note that these codes are quite old and were written with minimal care :D
